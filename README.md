# Facebook names

Some notebooks where I use the data from the 2021 Facebook leak to analyse surnames and first names.

Here's the content of the ordered notebooks:

1. Extracting the data from the raw files
2. reproducing a paper about diversity estimation using a name classification model
3. Training this model on facebook data
4. Comparing the two models on different datasets
5. Some examples of what to do with the first names dataset.
